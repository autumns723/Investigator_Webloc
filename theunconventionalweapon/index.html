						<p>An almost total stranger who now regrets his decision to find room-mates on Croakslist.</p>
						<p>&ldquo;I had dinner in the living room. Around 7, I headed to bed - that's when I saw McGuffin in the hallway walking towards the bathroom. By 9, I was in bed when I heard the most blood-curdling scream from the bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
